This project is a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset. It explores the relationships between passenger features and survival, with enhanced visualizations and basic data cleaning.

🔍 Project Highlights
Handles missing values (like Age)

Descriptive statistics for numeric features

Distribution and outlier detection using histograms and boxplots

Correlation analysis with a heatmap

Visual exploration of feature interactions with pairplots

Bar plots to compare survival rates by class and gender

📁 Files Included
Titanic-Dataset.csv – the dataset used

titanic_eda_alt.py or titanic_eda_alt.ipynb – this version of the EDA

README.md – project documentation

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repo or download the script/notebook.

Place Titanic-Dataset.csv in the same directory.

Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook step-by-step.

🔍 Key Visuals
Histograms: Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch

Boxplots: Outlier detection

Correlation Matrix: Heatmap of numeric features

Pairplot: Relationships by survival status

Barplots: Survival by gender and class

🧠 Insights Gained
Most passengers were in 3rd class, with lower survival rates

Women and children had a significantly higher chance of survival

Fares were highly skewed, with outliers

Some features (like Pclass and Fare) are strongly correlated
